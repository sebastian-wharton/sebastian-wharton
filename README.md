  Hello World! I have a bit of coding experience at this point, but new 
to uploading my local repos to github. If anyone has any advice for 
freshies or self taught devs, i'm all ears. On a personal note I have a baby boy named
Ajax who I love more than anything.

  My short-term goal is to acquire a position as a front-end web developer.
In the long-term I will learn the back end and transition into a full-stack engineer.

  Coding is a passion of mine that i'm now seriously pursuing as a career.
Learning new things is difficult; I fail all the time, but I have never 
grown more as a result. I hope to make many friends, work on exciting projects, 
& take in as much information as I can.

  I will see what I'm truly capable of by constantly challenging myself
